            <h1>True story of Internet – People Part 4</h1>
            <p>
                In 21st century, humans’ value, worship happiness according to idealist or money or power, but most desire the need for communication. Nowadays communication is changing compared to old days. Back then, the content we read, watched and listened to was controlled by government-controlled media on televisions. The content we view was what the media wanted to show for viewership and TPR. Now our daily life is influenced by world wide web (WWW). Companies such as YouTube, Facebook, Google etc., began to convert the web into 2-way democratic media controlled by no one but ourselves.  Now we know, web has changed the way we view the content on the internet. WWW has changed the world, but real story is about how world has changed the web.
                Chad Hurley, Kevin Ross, and J Adelson are the leaders of Web revolution. Ross and Adelson ran Digg (American news aggregator) social news website, content chosen by millions. Chad Hurley became the co-founder of YouTube, an amazing video sharing service which changed the way people view content on the internet. We might think, these guys who are the leaders of tech world is in to get rich and maybe they are, but these leaders are also on a mission to change the way we use technology and become innovative minds. Technology nowadays give people more power than it ever did in the past. We as people are becoming more innovative with new technology at our disposable. There are more and more innovative inventions and finds in the world, because of the new technology we have as our resource. On the internet, there are unlimited resources that is helpful.
                Let’s talk about TV industry and how hard it was to get into. Nowadays a video posted on YouTube goes viral in matter of minutes, that was not the case in 20th century. Back then, the news on TV or reading the newspaper was the only source to know what was going on around you. Now, tv industry is taken over by platforms such as YouTube and other live streaming services. As YouTube’s slogan states, “Broadcast Yourself”, this represents the creativities and/or expression of an individual. You are the owner of your content and it is not controlled by media or government. In the past, big shots and government controlled the media industry. They controlled the gates of distribution, controlled what was being produced for viewership of public, but now public can be heard and express themselves on YouTube platform. One of the best feature YouTube added to the platform was the broadcast channels. These broadcast channels gave millions of people around the world their own channels to be creative and express themselves. With the technology platforms at our disposable, we can be heard more than ever before. As individuals, we must put our creative and innovative minds to work in today’s advanced technology world we live in.
                Guys like David Weekly (MP3 Pioneer), Cabel Sasser (Co-Founder of Panic Software), Justin Frankel (Co-Creator Winamp), changed our point of view about music, mp3 and records. Our lives were so limited when it came to music back in the days being on records, CDs and radios. If these guys have not discovered more easier way to access music than we would have still been limited to records, CDs and cassettes. Also, Shawn Fanning (Founder of Napster), came up with a idea of Napster in 1995, which allowed people to search media from multiple computers and allowed to download into their own computers. Napster was the fastest spreading software for being free media platform. It was only matter of time when record companies had enough, where Hillary Rosen accused Napster being illegal since it had no copywrites to music. Lots people were against the idea of Napster, their motive was to take down Napster. Hillary Rosen filed a lawsuit against Napster for stealing their copywrites. Napster had to shut down but it encouraged Steve Jobs to create iTunes music store with strict copywrites and which made labels very happy.
                Court said Napster broke the law, but it broke lots of platforms. Lots of big companies such a Viacom and MTV, were not in favor of YouTube for providing their content. Viacom had filed a lawsuit against YouTube, accusing of content appearing on their site without using copyrights. YouTube has taken down material with copyrights issues if owner has asked them to. It was difficult to take down YouTube, unlike Napster, YouTube was not unfunded platform anymore. Facebook started out with small platform which became popular within no time at all. Mark Zuckerberg, Harvard dropout, made this user-friendly platform which connected lots of people globally. While Facebook was growing day by day, Myspace was introduced to people overnight which gave tough competition to Facebook.
                Web was not just about making money, but it is about setting communication free. Craig Newmark, founder of craigslist, and Jimmy Wales, founder of Wikipedia, introduced opensource non-profited software to community. Web was finally turning into huge platform. People who created world wide web only had idea about two communication, but they never thought of media and lots of other platforms taking over. WWW is turning into wiki and no one had idea where will be a stop, every decade in web is coming with new innovations and allowing newcomers to show their talents.
