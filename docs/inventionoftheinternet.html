            <h1>The Invention of the Internet </h1>
            <p>
                The internet defining technology of our time and historic revolution and committed patience for
                human race that is changing the world. Internet enables the millions of people with personal computers
                to communicate and connect. It is about emails, News group, chat box, world’s biggest marketplace and a
                shopping mall. But where did the internet come from? How did it get started? And who built this
                essential tool and playful toy to millions and where is it going?
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the age of internet, global network of computer-based communication. In the beginning of 21st
                century, millions of people are online everyday to exchange emails, conduct business, meet people and
                find information. Internet always has been free from the day one. Computer communications can also be
                tool of war, manage materials, but the internet is also vital information link, during the crisis it
                carried lots of useful news, videos and real stories. Although, its origins only go back to 1950s,
                since it was going to be the fastest growing invention that has touched so many lives. “It is something
                that we did not see with telephones, with the automobile or the printing press. It is an absolutely
                incredible communication tool that gives us an instance access to things happening everywhere”,
                states Peter Salvus, an author.
            </p>
            <p>In scope, more emails are exchanged on the internet today than first class letters delivered by US
                post office. Internet has generated 301 billion dollars in business in 1998. It was also responsible
                for total 1/3rd of the economic growth. No one has control over the internet. Similar idea
                about the internet was envisioned in 1950s by psychologist named J.C.R. Licklider, professor
                at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His vision was to computers allow you to communicate
                better so it might be useful to share information among people. Hollywood has portrayed idea
                of worldwide communications of computers as sci-fi, robots and flying saucer.

                After all the first computer was large and very expensive, and never intend to use for communication.
                Computer was as big as a room, barely had one computer in city or one computer on campus if you were
                to be lucky enough. During 1950s, United states and the Soviet Union were working to develop new
                technology.  In oct 1957, Soviet Union launched Sputnik during cold war. TO catch us and hopefully
                surpass the soviet in space technology, President Dwight Eisenhower created the Bureau of Defense
                Department called ARPA (Advanced Research Project Agency). When the space programs got their own
                agency NASA, America decided to beat the Russians in the space. Dr. Leonard Kleinrock, who developed
                mathematical theory behind packet switching, where first message was tested on two computers on a
                network that was precursor of the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fear of Soviet nuclear attack, telephone system was so damaged that military would be unable to launch
                counterattack. American needed indestructible communications network, Dr. Paul Baran was hired to
                create one. Paul Baran and his team started working on network using fishnet. They used hot potato
                routing, study of mice in a maze to find a way to network. After borrowing the idea of from telegraph,
                they have decided to use same method with the communication. By 1962 to they had enough researched and
                theories to implement that network can be built but they would have to wait till 7 more years.

                April 1971, ARPAnet had 18 mainframes hooked up to internet, at first there were not much to do
                on ARPAnet except transferring datafiles, but new app called Email was introduced. Ray Tomlinson is
                credited as the inventor of email; in 1971, he developed the first system able to send mail
                between users on different hosts across the ARPANET, using the @ sign to link the username with a
                destination server. In 1972, ARPAnet tuned science fiction into science fact and this idea did take
                over the world. Robert Metcalfe, inventor of internet, found 19 different things to do internet that
                could be done such a game, calculator, emails and many others. Project did crash on their first demo
                in the first conference.b</p>
            <p>
                In 1973, Vint Cert and Robert E. Kahn teamed up to developed new rules known as TCP/IP. ARPANET
                adopted TCP/IP on January 1, 1983, and from there researchers began to assemble the “network o
                f networks” that became the modern Internet. Internet was developed for defense research and it was
                restricted to research project and university. Still it was not reach main street USA, but major
                milestone was about to see all the change. Internet grew by the faith of fortune of new technology
                that brought new desktop pc, silicone chip, high speed modem and computer mouse.

                However, on June 9th, 1992, Congress passed the bill taking the internet out the governments hand and
                making it open to public. By allowing free enterprise and allowing access to internet, unimagine used
                of commercial and sites. Tim Berners-Lee invented world wild web. It was not user friendly at first.
                In 1992, it only had 50 webpages. By late 90s, internet was completely redefined use of personal
                computer. Only reason there are computers and television, is because of Internet. At present there
                are 11 million domain names and nearly 70 million webpages.
