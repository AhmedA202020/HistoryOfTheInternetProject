                Have you ever imagined web without google? There was no way to navigating throughout the internet but platforms
                like Yahoo and Excite, some of the brightest super nerdy people solved this problem. Let us look at search
                revolution from the start. In the web today, if you search someone by their name, it will provide you all the
                possible information related to search. Ten years, there were two sources Yahoo and Excite were rivals when
                it came to navigating web.

                BBN started working on IMPs on January 1, 1969. They had very little time of 9 months. It was very messy
                undone project that no one has worked on it before. Lot of graduate students were hired to work on the
                first IMP. They must make the idea work of sending message from one to another computer. While working on
                this project, they have faced a lot of obstacles like how to stop package circulating forever or where it
                needs to stop. There was no guarantee that it would work out. There were a lot of glitches that BBN faced.
                Lots of people devoted to this project while some people were more focused on the deadline.

                April 1971, ARPAnet had 18 mainframes hooked up to internet, at first there were not much to do on ARPAnet
                except transferring datafiles, but new app called Email was introduced. Ray Tomlinson is credited as the
                inventor of email; in 1971, he developed the first system able to send mail between users on different hosts
                across the ARPANET, using the @ sign to link the username with a destination server. In 1972, ARPAnet tuned
                science fiction into science fact and this idea did take over the world. Robert Metcalfe, inventor of internet,
                found 19 different things to do internet that could be done such a game, calculator, emails and many others.
                Project did crash on their first demo in the first conference.

                Google was search engine that cared about search once again. Since there was so much traffic on Google,
                Stanford had requested them to move out of campus. Vinod Khosla, khosla ventures, interested in working
                with Google. Khosla suggested Google to combine with Excite to rival against Yahoo. It was not only Excite
                who failed to see Google’s potential, but every search company in Silicone valley turned them flat. Larry
                and Sergey were desperate to get financial help from different inventors. David R. Cheriton (Professor of
                Computer Science at Stanford university) and Andy Bechtolsheim (Co-founder of Sun Microsystems Inc.) gave in
                their interest to invest in Google worth of $100,000 check on their first meeting. Andy put in a lot of faith
                in them. Also, John Doerr, invested in Google with no sign of bigger revenue. Larry and Sergey were eager to
                provide the biggest search engine of all time with time of investors.
