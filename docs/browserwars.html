            <h1> The True story of the Internet- Browser Wars part 1</h1>
            <p>
                This Video talks about the browser war that occurred between Microsoft and Netscape. It all began when
                Marc Anderseen invented a new way to chase and retrieve information from the Internet "the Netscape
                Navigator". Netscapes rising sales and the phenomenal heightenth of the Internet make its mete outs go
                through the roof and scour before the Company had any profit it was valued at $2.7 billion. However, the
                scenario didnt go that well for so long and a very powerful and ambitious man came into the picture.
                Bill provide put 2,000 of his best programmers to stool a browser of his own The Explorer. The battle of
                the browsers officially started Microsofts share of the browser commercialize increased from 2.9 percent
                at the end of 1995 to more than than 40 percent by the end of 1997, while Netscapes commercialize share
                fell to 54 percent.The Internet was growing at an big(p) pace and many people believed that it was going
                to affect every chore. However, Gates dismissed the Internet and Netscape as unimportant, saying that
                they would have no concussion on him. He quickly found out how wrong he was and how these new threats in
                the environment were going to affect his business, and he managed to envision the way for converting
                this threat into an opportunity. Thus, he changed the direction of his strategy and he entered into a
                new business the Internet world. He realized that he was wanting(p) out an opportunity in the market
                that could make his company grow in a huge way so he adopted a follower strategy, which is very ironic
                knowing that they have eer been the leaders. He strategically fit-in by matching his resources and
                strengths (capital, know-how and people) to the changing environment. As Netscape was ahead he needed to
                act quickly before it was too late, so he took advantage of his power as a leader and think on regaining
                position over Netscape by adding the browser as an integral part of Windows, giving free copies to the
                public and forcing manufacturers to install the browser on the machine. In other words, he used his best
                existing resource which was Microsoft Windows as part of the strategy and used his monopoly to stifle
                argument and defeat its rivals. However, this strategic choice could have never succeeded at the
                business level, if Microsoft wouldnt have the competitive advantage of understanding the customer and
                the market as they do.
